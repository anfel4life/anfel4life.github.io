                            processes. We figured out possible risks of low system latency, explained to the client what
                            they might lead to and how we were going to resolve that issue.

                            the software by 50% with the all enabled features.

                            what difficulties could have been faced if some detail had been missed. They began with
                            mockups and discussing future functionality with customer in order to create interface that
                            could be easily extended with new items. The client could select between several options
                            that our designers provided to him.

                        <p>One of crucial features of the application is using analytics data and services from
                            customer’s internal system. Client wanted additional functionality to maintain user roles
                            and groups, administrate the application through internal system and synchronize data
                            between them.

                            that used microservices and industry standard authorization protocol. The functionality of
                            the internal system was extended in order to meet needs of integration process and workflow
                            was carefully tested to ensure the quality of the integration solution.

                            low latency was one of the key points to differentiating their product among other

                        <p>The application is a data analysis tool with rich web interface that processes and
                            manipulates dozens of gigabytes of data in real time. All data is stored on AWS cloud which
                            is processed with the help of Apache Spark stream. After processing, data is loaded into a
                            distributed in-memory warehouse MemSQL. A user operates with graphical tools on the web
                            interface where he can observe various representation of data, create and manage price plan.
